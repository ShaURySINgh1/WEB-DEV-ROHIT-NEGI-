                                                            COMPUTER NETWORK.

ARPANET 4 universites of america made up


before that internet also exist but it as too much flaw: 
          1) CIRCUIT SWITCHING: USES TELEPHONIC NETWORK WIRES( where people use to plug & unplug the connection of b/w RECEIVER & SENDER so there was no privacy because other people can hear and see those messages) so telephone can only read/understand digital signal so WE NEED TO CONVERT THIS signal into DIGITAL SIGNAL (BINARY LANGUAGE BASE OF 2 [O & 1])
             SO THEY USED MODEM[MODILATOR & DEMODILATOR] USE TO CONVERT ANALOG SIGNAL TO BINARY CODE DIGITAL SIGNAL & VICE VERSA.

THEN SOME MESSAGE SWITCHES COMES INTO PLACE 
          2) MESSAGE SWITCHING: IT TAKES ALL THE MESSAGES IN A SINGLE WAPPER/PACKET FROM THE SENDER AND GIVES TO THE RECEIVER AT ONCE AND ALL THROUGH THE NODES/ROUTER [SO DO TO SIZE OF MESSAGE BANDWITH WERE LOW THAT TIME, SO MUCH HUGE LATENCY OF DELIVERING MESSAGES IS RAISED UP.

 APARNET COMES IN FIX ALL PROBLEM

APARNET: ESTABLISED IN 1960 AND THERE FIRST MESSAGE WHICH THEY SUCCESSFULLY DELIVERED WAS [LOGIN] IN 1969.THOUGH ONLY STARTING TWO LETTER SUCCEED TO DELIVER (L,O) THEN THEIR SYSTEM CRASHED BUT THEY GET THE IDEA THAT THIS THING WORKED UP FOR THEM.
         THE MECHANISM THEY USED IS [PACKET SWITCHING]

PACKET SWITCHING: SLICING, PEIRCING, CUTTING THE LARGE SIZED DATA INTO SMALL PIECE OF CHUNKS OF PACKETS. eg: 100Mb of data they split it into the small size of packets part each having one tenth size of 100Mb.

AND any packet go through any telephone lines path they will delivered to the same place.[ THAT IS HOW TORRENT WORKS AND BITTORENTS AND EVERY O.THER ALL SOCIAL MEDIA, TWITCH,YT AND BANKING SECTOR WORKS ]

EVERY PACKET CONTAINS: DELIVERY ADDRESS, SOURCE ADDRESS, MINIMUM SIZE CONTAIN.




                                                                          IP ADDRESS [INTERNET PROTOCAL ADDRESS]
1974: AMERICA ESTABSLISED- TCP/IP these are rules to make the internet work through the rule: because every other country want it to make the internet as they want.

TCP/IP: ROUTER/NODE CAN`T READ AND UNDERSTAND EVERY DIFFERENT CHARACTERS SO THE USA MADE UP ASCII values, UTF-8,UTF-16,UTF-32.

PACKETS MUST HAVE SOURCE ADDRESS,DESTINATION ADDRESS,MINIMUM SIZE OF EACH PACKETS, ROUTE OF PACKET.

Eg: TWO COUNTRY HAVE DIFFERENT LANGUAGES BUT TO INTERACT WITH EACH OTHER THEY MUST COMES WITH SINGLE LANGUAGE THAT IS HOW TCP/IP PROTOCOL MADE UP.


                                                                    IP ADDRESS- UNIQUE ADDRESS 
TO DELIVER EVERY THING & ANYTHING IN THE WORLD WE NEED RECEIVER ADDRESS AND VERIFY IT RECEIVER NEEDS SOURCE/SENDER ADDRESS 
THIS WHOLE IP ADDRESS[NETWORKING SYSTEM] IS MADE UP THROUGH USING POST OFFICE SYSTEM THATS HOW INTERNET MADE UP.

EVERY OTHER IP ADDRESS HAS UNIQUE ADDRESS.

IP ADDRESS: 32BITS also known as IPV4 [4 BYTES= 32Bits]  1BYTE = 8BITS  => MB>Mb [ Byte(B) , bit(b) ]   bits are made up by LOGIC GATES [electron trap in a GATE]

      IP ADDRESS: FORMAT=> 192.36.15.8   HOW IS THIS MADE UP AND THIS FORMAT WE FOLLOWS ONLY.

                          0-255.0-255.0-255.0-255  THIS IS HOW IP NUMBER HAVE FORMAT AND LIMIT

WE CAN SEE OUR IP ADDRESS THROUGH OUR TERMINAL IP ADDRESS CONTAINS OUR DETAILED LOCATION THAT WHERE WE ARE LIVES. IP ADDRESS HAVE OUR INTERNET PROVIDER DNS ADDRESS


IPV4[ 4 BYTES ]=> 32 BITS   [1 BYTE. 1BYTE. 1BYTE. 1BYTE] => THIS MADE UP FOR HUMANS SO THEY CAN READ IT.

                            [8 BIT. 8 BIT . 8 BIT. 8 BIT] => 2 TO THE POWER OF 8 [2^8]=[256 TOTAL {0 OR 1}

WHENEVER WE CONNECT TO INTERNET FOR FIRST TIME I GET THE IP ADDRESS FROM THE INTERNET PROVIDER. [ SOURCE SENDER & RECEIVER BOTH THE IP ADDRESS DEPENDING UPON THEIR LOCATION]

ALL THE DEVICES WHICH CONNECT THE INTERNET ARE ROUTERS,NODES AND THEY HAVE THEIR ONE INDEPENDENT IP ADDRESS.

IF 32 BITS OF IP ADDRESS WE HAVE SO HOW MANY DEVICES WE CAN GIVE THE ADDRESS OF THESE IP 

2 TO THE POWER OF 32 [2^32 = 4,294,967,296] , BUT THERE ARE MORE THAN BILLIONS OF DEVICE SO HOW THEY CAN COVER UP ALL THE DEVICE WHO CONNECT TO INTERNET THERE ARE ONLY 429 CRORES OF IP ADDRESS.

NOW IN 20`s CENTURY WE USE IPV6 [ ITS WRITTEN IN HEXADECIMAL 16 TO THE POWER OF 32]

TO SEARCH THE WEBSITE IN THE SEARCH ENGINE NOW WE DONT PUT UP THEIR IP ADDRESS TO OPEN UP THEIR WEBPAGE INSTEAD WE SEARCH THIER WEBSITE NAME WITH THEIR DOMAIN NAME HOW IS THIS WORK.
           =>IT POSSIBLE BY THE HELP OF DNS: 

                                                         DOMAIN NAME SYSTEM [DNS] [COMPUTERS ONLY UNDERSTAND THE IP ADDRESS] NOT THE DOMAIN NAME BUT WE AS A HUMAN CANNONT MEMORISE ALL THE WEBSITES DOMAIN NAME.
                                                         WE ARE MORE FIMALIER TO LETTER`S LIKE ADDRESS Eg: YOUTUBE.COM BUT COMPUTERS BROWSER DONT UNDERSTAND THIS.
CILENT GIVES REQUEST AND SERVER FULLFILL THEIR REQUESTS.

LETS SEE HOW THIS WORKS: DNS CONVERT INTO IP ADDRESS IN THE BROWSER [ BROWSER USE TO RENDER THE PROGRAMMING LANGUAGES TO SHOW THE INTERFACE ].

                                 WE SEARCH THE YT IN BROWSER OUR REQUEST GO TO [ISP- INTERNET SERVICE PROVIDER]

       IPS HAVE CACHE MEANS PRE-CONTAIN DATA [CACHE MEANS MEMORY A FAST READ AND WRITE MEMORY USED IN CPUs, RAM & GPUs etc] SO THE WEBSITE OPEN TOO FASTLY [MEANS KISI BHI WEBSITE KO BAHOT JADA VISITS KARTE H TOH WOH BAHOT JALDI KHUL JATI H MAGAR HUM KISI WEBSITE PHELI BAAR OPEN KARTE TOH WOH TIME LETI H KHULNE ME THAT IS WHAT CACHE MEMORY DO]

IF MORE PEOPLE COMING TO SOME SERVER SO THEY STORE THE CACHE DATA OF THAT WEBSITE IN THEIR SERVER. BUT IF ISO DONT HAVE THE THAT CACHE SO IT SEARCH THAT IP FROM THE OTHER SERVER LIKE ROOT NAME SERVER.


RNS[ROOT NAME SERVER] GIVES THE PORTAL OF ANY SPECFIC DOMAIN SERVER NAME WEBSITE LIKE [ .com .net .gov .in etc]

SO THE RNS SAYS TO ISP KI ME TUJHE ASEY SERVER KE PASS BHEJ DETA HU KI JISME SAME DOMAIN KA SERVER ME SAME [.com or .in or .net] ke sare listed website ka list ho

toh RNS ISP KO USH SERVER KE PASS POCHAYA JINME .com WALE WEBSITE KI LIST[INFORMATION] HO PURI.    RNS only read type of domain requested website have and give the ISP that server where that domain list[information] have.

then ISP COMES TO TLD [TOP LEVEL DOMAIN- server] & TLD DONT GIVE THE IP ADDRESS TO ISP but IT GIVES THE ANOTHER SERVER NAME WHICH HAVE THE REQUESTED WEBSITE IP ADDRESS.[ THIS SERVER CALLED AS ANS[ AUTHORITIVE NAME SERVER ].

CLIENT REQUEST IN BROWSER-> ISP-> RNS-> TLD ->ISP-> ANS-> ISP-> CLIENT BROWSER.

FASTEST-> RESISTOR > CACHE > RAM > GPUs > CPUs > SSD > HHD


THERE ARE TWO TYPES OF IP ADDRESSES:                              THERE ARE 13 TOTAL TLD SERVER IN THE WORLDWIDE.

1) STATIC IP ADDRESS: WEBSITES WHOSE IP ADDRESSES NEVER CHANGED THEY ARE REGISTERED ONLINE [eg: YOUTUBE etc]
2) DYNAMIC IP ADDRESS: WEBSITES WHOSE IP ADDRESSES GETS CHANGED [ NORMAL USER LIKE US OUR IP ADDRESS GETS TAKEN FROM THE INTERNET SO THAT ISP CAN GIVE TO OTHER PEOPLES ALSO TO THEIR USERS THEY RE-ALLOCATE THE IP ADDRESSES AMONG THE USERS ].

THERE ARE TOO MANY [ANS] SERVERS AND ALL HAVE SAME INFORMATION AT A TIME IF ANY SERVER IS FREE THEN NOW ITS DUTY OF ANS TO GIVE THE IP OF REQUESTED WEBSITE TO THE ISP. 

                                        DNS PROVIDER => HOSTINGER,GO DADDY.

EVERY DOMAIN HAS DIFFERENT TYPES TLD

  WHO GIVE WRITES TO GODADDY TO SELL DOMAIN

IP ADDRESS WE CLASSIFY THE IP ADDRESS INTO THE 5 PARTS:

CLASS A: I GAVE 50% OF IP ADDRESS TO THIS. EXAMPLE=> [0-127] BITS OF ADDRESSES [0-127. 0-127. 0-127. 0-127]
CLASS B: 25%  [128-191._____._____._____]
CLASS C:12.5% [192-223._____._____._____]
CLASS D:6.25% [224-239._____._____._____]
CLASS E:6.25% [240-255._____._____._____]


{0-255._____._____._____} => 256-BITS [32 BYTES]

WHY CLASSES ARE MADE UP?

EVERY NETWORK PROVIDER IP ADDRESS IS DIFFERENTS OUR ROUTER & SIM IP ARE DIFFERENT.

IPV4: 32-bit } STANDARD 

MACHINE -> connects to wifi or internet and data request/send goes to routers/nodes some data transfer to the (optical fiber)wire which supports Analog System, Digital Signals[ 0/1 ] if two systems want to talk each other they want to each other they must have each other address [so my system needs a reader or the system to tell that system how much amount of my address are need to give the exact IP ADDRESS so it reader reads the address then give the IP ADDRESS accordingly.

 so it converts this address into the packets so everyone has [2 to the power of 32 bits] of ADDRESS and split it into the chunks.

in 90`s century we make the 32bit of IP ADDRESS then why don't we made the 64bits of IP ADDRESS [binary code] instead we made up 128bits of IP ADDRESS because we had knew that 64bits won't be enough for the future



OUR RAM & MEMORY have bits of 1,2,4,8,16,32,64,128,256,512,1040,2040 and so on. because it those components are built up from the binary systems so they store the data or render it like that

now WE HAVE IPV6=> [2¹²⁸ or 2^128 bits] to it is enough for more than 200yrs.


IPV6: IS BEEN READED IN HEXADECIMAL SYSTEM [BASE OF 16 = 16 CHARACTERS] 0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,A,B,C,D,E,F.

WHY DID THE CLASSES ARE MADE UP FOR THE IP ADDRESS.

WHENEVER I GET CONNECT TO THE INTERNET I GET THE IP ADDRESS.

LET A COMPANY this company give the [IPV4 400CRORES+ ADDRESSES] IP ADDRESS TO EVERY ONE IN THE WORLD WHOEVER WILL COME INTO THE INTERNET AND REQUEST THEN ONLY ONE THIS COMPANY WILL GIVE THE IP ADDRESS.

THIS COMPANY'S SYSTEM AND SERVER WILL GET FAIL AND CRASHED (I KNOW THERE ARE 2 TYPES OF IP ADDRESS STATIC & DYNAMIC & DYNAMIC IP ADDRESS USE MORE SO WHENEVER ALL GET CONNECT TO THE SERVER TASK LIKE THIS IT WILL EXPLODE.

IF WE HAD THIS TYPE OF SYSTEM ,THE IP ADDRESS WILL DISTRIBUTE RANDOMLY & THEN INTERNET WILL GET SLOWED.

   WHY WILL THE INTERNET WILL GET SLOWED?
=> THERE IS ONE AUTHORITY [ IANA = INTERNATIONAL ASSIGNED NUMBER AUTHORITY ].

IANA HAVE THE DUTY TO DISTRIBUTE THE IP ADDRESS TO OTHER'S 


THEY DIVIDED IP ADDRESSES INTO THE 5 DIFFERENT COUNTRIES OR CONTINENTS[REGIONS] [ASIA-PACIFIC,NORTH-AMERICA,SOUTH-AMERICA,EUROPE,AFRICA,MIDDLE-EAST]

THEY SELL THE ADDRESSES TO THE 5 DIFFERENT REGIONS TO DISTRIBUTE IN THEIR OWN REGIONS.

SO THE [ASIA-PACIFIC] AUTHORITY GIVES/SELL THE IP ADDRESS TO DISTRIBUTE THE ISP[INTERNET SERVICE PROVIDER] SO THEY CAN PROVIDE IP ADDRESS TO THEIR COUNTRIES LIKE: AIRTEL,VODAFONE-IDEA,JIO & BSNL. TO DISTRIBUTE THE IP ADDRESS TO THE OTHER PEOPLE IN THE COUNTRY SO THE PEOPLE CAN ACTIVE ON THE INTERNET BY UNIQUELY IP ADDRESSESS.




WHY DID WE DIVIDED THE IP ADDRESSES INTO THE CLASSES?

LET AIRTEL,BSNL,JIO & VODAFONE-IDEA => WANTS 10-20CRORES OF IP ADDRESSES 
AND SOME COUNTRIES WANT THE ONLY 10-20LAKHS OF IP ADDRESSES.


SO WHENEVER WE DIVIDE THE IP ADDRESS WE DIVIDE THEM INTO THE MEANINGFULL WAY
LET IF WE ASK THE ISP(JIO) FOR 1CRORE IP ADDRESS SO IT WILL DISTURBS OTHER & INTERNET WILL GO DOWN.



LET SUPPOSE FROM THE [73.0.0.0 TO 73.255.255.255] of IP ADDRESS ARE GIVEN TO JIO (ISP).



 IPV6 HEXADECIMAL(256BITS)    [   73.0.0.0  ]
                                     ↓
                              [   73.255.255.255 ] SO 2²⁴ OF IP ADDRESS GIVEN ( 1.67 CRORES OF IP ADDRESS HAS BEEN GIVEN )


ISP WHO WANTS CRORES OF IP ADDRESS ARE VERY LOW.

AND THERE ARE MANY COUNTRIES WHO WANTS ONLY  LAKHS OF IP ADDRESS SO THERE ARE ISP LIKE THIS.

THE NUMBER OF ISP WHO WANTS CRORES OF IP ADDRESS FROM THE IANA THEY ARE TAKEN UNDER THE CLASS A.



CLASS A: 0-127._._._

CLASS A=> ARE DIVIDED INTO THE TWO PORTIONS ONE IS [NETWORK ID] & [HOST ID].

2⁷=128 OF NETWORK [IDEA,JIO,AIRTEL etc] ARE THERE ID ARE TOTAL IN CLASS A

NETWORK ID: 1st 8bit will tells you about the network ID.
HOST ID: lasts 24 bits will tells you about the HOST ID. HOST ID CONTENTS HOSTS [2²⁴ => 1.67+ CRORES]

32BITS IN TOTAL  we know class A IP ADDRESS will start from 0 in first place of digits





LET SAY IANA SELL THE ALL OF THE IP ADDRESS WHO'S STARTING FROM THE 73 BUT IDEA SAYS THEY WANTS MORE IP ADDRESSES SO IANA WILL GIVE THE IDEA ALL 73,74,75,76,77 and so on of the 

SO ONE NETWORK ID IN CLASS A: 0-128 HAVE 1.67+ crores of IP ADDRESS.

SABSE JADA IP ADDRESS JIN ISP WALO KO CHAHIYE UNKI SANKHYA KAM HOGI UNH ISP WALO SE JINKO BAHOT KAM IP ADDRESS CHAHIYE HOGI.
THAT'S WHY CLASSES ARE MADE UP IN FIRST PLACE


HOST ID: 2²⁴ YE APNE SE DO ADDRESS KO BAHAR NIKAL DETA KHUD KELIYE 


ONE SAYS FIRST ADDRESS WILL BE FOR [NETWORK ADDRESS] 
AND SECOND FOR [BROADCAST ADDRESS]

TOH AGAR 73.0.0.0 ADDRESS HOGA AGAR PHELA KA TOH WOH NETWORK ADDRESS KA HOGA WOH KHUD KELIYE REVERSE KAREGA
AUR LAST 73.255.255.255 ADDRESS HOGA LAST WALA TOH YE BROADCAST ADDRESS KA HOGA 

IN DONO KE BICH ME JITNE BHI IP ADDRESS HONGE WOH PUBLIC KO MILE JAYENGE.

WHAT IS NETWORK ADDRESS?
LET SAY IF THERE IS A ISP COMPANY SO THEY MUST HAVE A SERVER SO TO GIVE/HOST THE IP ADDRESS TO THE PUBLIC THEY ALSO WANT AN IP ADDRESS SO THEY RESERVE THEIR FIRST IP ADDRESS.

WHAT IS BROADCAST ADDRESS?
IT IS THE LAST IP ADDRESS WHICH THE ISP COMPANY OWN IT SO THE ISP COMPANY USE IT TO SEND THE SAME/INDENTICAL MESSAGE AMONG ITS USER 
TO SEND THE SAME MESSAGE TO ALL OF PEOPLE THEY USE THE BROADCAST ADDRESS. 




BIG COMPANY(JIO etc)GOT CLASS A IP ADDRESS 
MID COMPANY WHO WANTS LAKH OF IP ADDRESS GOT CLASS B 
AND SOO ON THAT IS THIS IP ADDRESS CLASS HELP TO DISTINGUISH THE COMPANIES OF ISP.



IANA GIVE WHOLE NETWORK OF CLASS (1-126) NETWORK -126 NETWORK 
1 NETWORK= 1.67 crores+ IP ADDRESS 

CLASS B HAS 2¹⁴ NETWORKS [1 NETWORK HAVE THE 65K+ IP ADDRESS]

CLASS C HAS 2²¹ NETWORKS [ 1 NETWORK HAVE 254 IP ADDRESS -HOST ID: 2⁸-2 ] EVERY SMALL NEEDED COMPANY TAKES THIS.


CLASS D DON'T HAVE A NETWORK ID & HOST ID 

CLASS D HAVE MULTITASKING [MUJHE JABHI KISI KO MESSAGE BHEJNA HOTA H

CLASSS D IP ADDRESS ALWAYS START FROM:- 1110 _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _  [IT HAS 2²⁸ => IP ADDRESSES]

CLASS D USE FOR ZOOM CALL,GOOGLE MEET,DISCORD LIKE APPS.
SO WE CAN'T USE OTHER CLASSES IP ADDRESS BECAUSE EVERYONE CALL EACHOTHER FROM THE DIFFERENT PART OF WORLD.

SO WHENEVER WE CONNECT TO THE LIVE CALLS AND VIDEO CALL WE DON'T SEND OUR DATA TO EVERY ONE BY ONE WE SEND OUR DATA TO MULTITASKING NETWORK OF CLASS D THEN THAT NETWORK WILL GIVE THE LIVE DATA TO EVERYONE AT EVERY SINGLE TIME.

CLASS E: START FROM [1111 _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _  [IT HAS 2²⁸ => IP ADDRESSES]
ALL CLASS E IP ADDRESSES WE HAVE RESERVED FOR THE FUTURE,WE HAVEN'T USE THEM YET AND DIDN'T GAVE TO ANYONE. 



           TOPOLOGY+VPN 

TYPES OF NETWORK:

1) LAN: LOCAL AREA NETWORK : NETWORK WHICH WORK IN A SMALL AREA LIKE HOMES, OFFICES.

OUR DEVICES CONNECT TO THE ROUTER THROUGH THE ETHERNET OR THE INTERNET. [IF ALL DEVICES ARE CONNECTED TO THE SAME ROUTER THEN THEIR IP ADDRESSES ALSO BE THE SAME.]



PRIVATE IP ADDRESS:THESE ARE NOT AVAILABLE FOR PUBLIC USES BUT FOR THE SPECIFIC USES 
[OUR ROUTEE SO HAVE THE SAME IP ADDRESS THOSE HAVE DIFFERENT PRIVATE IP ADDRESSES].

DEVICES CONNECTED TO THE SAME ROUTER

     PUBLIC IP ADDRESS    PRIVATE IP ADDRESS [THEIR DEVICES]

DEVICE 1:  16.1.2.8       10.0.0.1
DEVICE 2:  16.1.2.8       10.0.0.2
DEVICES 3: 16.1.2.8       10.0.0.3

IF WE USE THE FACEBOOK SEND IT REQUEST THEN FACEBOOK WILL GIVE US THE RESPONSE ON THE BASIS OF PUBLIC IP ADDRESS BECAUSE OUR ALL DEVICES IP ADDRESS ARE SAME BECAUSE WE ALL CONTENT TO SAME ISP ROUTER LAN.

SO HOW EVERYONE GETS THEIR REQUESTED DATA ACCORDINGLY?

SO THE ROUTER WILL GIVE THE EACH DEVICES REQUESTED DATA ACCORDINGLY TO THEIR PRIVATE IP ADDRESSES. SO THAT EVERY GETS THEIR DATA WHICH THEY REQUESTED. [IP ADDRESSES ARE LIMITED].

2) MAN: METROPOLIAN AREA NETWORK [CITIES NETWORK].

IN THE CITY THERE ARE MANY LAN NETWORK ALL OVER THE AREAS IN THE CITY 
SO THE NETWORK WHO WILL CONNECT THE ALL THE LAN NETWORK[ROUTER/WIFI] TO THE ONE NETWORK THAT NETWORK IS CALLED AS METROPOLIAN AREA NETWORK[MAN]. [IF I SHARE MY INTERNET TO THE SOMEONE THEN I'M WORKING AS A ROUTER FOR THE ONE WHO IS USING MY INTERNET].


3) WIDE AREA NETWORK [WAN]: THE NETWORK WHICH CONNECT ALL THE COUNTRIES TO EACH THROUGH THE OPTICAL FIBRE CABLES UNDER THE OCEAN.

FASTEST DATA TRAVEL THROUGH THE CABLE NOT THROUGH THE AIR EVEN THE SPACE SATELITE NETWORK AREN'T THAT FAST.[THE DATA INSIDE THESE CABLE TRAVEL THROUGH THE 99.9% OF SPEED OF LIGHT].

DIFFERENT ISP CAN HAVE SIMILAR PRIVATE IP ADDRESS BECAUSE OUTSIDE OF THEIR COMPANIES ROUTER NO ONE KNOW ABOUT THEIR PRIVATE IP ADDRESSES.


=> TYPES OF TOPOLOGY [GRAPH THEORY'S CONCEPT]

1- BUS TOPOLOGY 
2- RING TOPOLOGY 
3- STAR TOPOLOGY [SWITCH HON]
4- MESH TOPOLOGY [EVERY DEVICE CONNECT TO EACH OTHER]
5- HYBRID TOPOLOGY: BUS & STAR [HYBRID]


                        VPN & DARK WEB

CILENT MACHINE CONNECTED TO MANY MANY ROUTER/NODE TO CONNECT WITH SERVER [SO ROUTER DECIDE WHERE THE DATA IN PACKETS SHOULD GO THROUGH WHICH ROUTE]

HOW ENCRYPTION WORKS?
OUR IP ADDRESS IS OPEN IT DOESN'T ENCRYPT.

IF WE WANT IT THAT NO-ONE ABLE TO SEE OUR MESSAGES
SO WE USE ENCRYPTION WHICH TRANSFER THE MY MESSAGE INTO DIFFERENT CHARACTERS THEN DELIVER THE MESSAGE TO THE SERVER AND SERVER DECRYPT IT.


HELLO -> Q49W [ENCRYPTION] SIP {END TO END ENCRYPTED}
Q49W  -> HELLO [DECRYPTION] DIP

WHEN WE VISIT ANY WEBSITE WE SEE [HTTPS = HYPER TEXT TRANSFER PROTOCOL SECURE] OUR DATA IS SECURED.
WHEN WE VISIT ANY WEBSITE IF WE SEE [HTTP = HYPER TEXT TRANSFER PROTOCOL] THIS IS NOT SECURED EVERYONE CAN SEE OUR DATA AND USE IT.

WHEN DATA GO THROUGH THE WIRE THEN WE CAN EASILY DETECT THE BITS [0 OR 1] THROUGH THE SOME SOFTWARES AND DEVICES.
BUT ISP KNOW ON WHICH SEEVER WEBSITE WE GOO BUT IT DON'T KNOW WHAT THINGS WE DID ON THAT SERVER. ON THE SERVER END [DNS CONTROLS].

PRIVACY IS THE MYTH

INCOGNITO MODE DON'T READ/STORE THE HISTORY IN OUR SYSTEM/MACHINE BUT THE ISP KNOWS WHERE AND ON WHICH WEBSITE YOU HAD GONE.
BECAUSE ISP KNOWS THE IP ADDRESS OF THAT WEBSITE SERVER WHICH WE ACCESS.


WHAT VPN[VIRTUAL PRIVATE NETWORK] DO:

IT SHOW US DIFFERENT IP ADDRESS BUT ACTUALLY OUR ORIGINAL IP ADDRESS WON'T CHANGE AT ALL BECAUSE:

1st WE CONNECT TO THE ISP THEN ISP CONNECT US TO THE VPN.

WHY WE CAN'T ABLE TO CONNECT TO THE SOME WEBSITE IN OUR COUNTRY?
BECAUSE ISP BLOCK THOSE [XYZ.COM OF ALL WEBSITE DOMAIN NAME] FOR US BY THE ORDER OF INDIAN GOVERNMENT.

1st WE GO TO ISP & REQUEST TO VISIT XYZ.COM THEN ISP REJECT THE REQUEST IF THE WEBSITE IS BANNED.


VPN: ISP CONNECTS US TO THE IP ADDRESS OF VPN AND VPN TOOK THE DATA OF THE SITE WE WANT WHICH IS RESTRICT WEBSITE AND GIVE US THE DATA OF THAT WEBSITE IN THE ENCRYPT FORM SO OUR ISP THINKS THAT THIS IP ADDRESS ISN'T BANNED SO IT GIVE US THE ALL OF THE DATA WE WANT.
BUT THE VPN PING WILL BE SLOW AND THE LATENCY IS HIGHER.

WHY WE CAN'T ACCESS THE TIKTOK THROUGH THE VPN BUT CAN ACCESS THE DATA FROM THE ADULT BAN WEBSITE.

SO THE COUNTRY GOVERNMENT FORCE THE COMPANY LIKE TIKTOK TO REJECT ALL THE REQUEST FROM THEIR COUNTRY.
AND VPN ALSO PROHIBIDENT THE ACCESS TO THOSE WEBSITE BECAUSE OF THE GOVERNMENT.

THEN WHY WHEN WE CONNECT TO THE VPN IT SHOWS DIFFERENT IP ADDRESS BUT OUR ACTUAL IP ADDRESS IS STILL THE SAME.
BECAUSE WE ASK THE IP ADDRESS OF OUR FROM THE WEBSITE AND THAT WEBSITE SHOWS THE DATA WHICH WE REQUEST FROM THE VPN SO IT'S VPN WHO IS SENDING OUR REQUEST TO THE IP ADDRESS FINDER AND THEN IP ADDRESS FINDER ONLY DETECT THE VPN IP ADDRESS INSTEAD OF OUR THEN THE DATA VPN GIVE US IT JUST MYTH THAT OUR IP ADDRESS IS SECURE FROM THE GOVERNMENT AFTER USING THE VPN.

WHY SOME TIME INTERNET GET SPEED UP WHILE USING VPN BECAUSE OUR ISP OR ROUTER MIGHT HAVE A RESTRICTION TO SLOW DOWN OUR INTERNET SPEED WHILE STREAMING SOMETHING.
how isp restrict the speed of data? it see the pattern of binary code data that how does we are using the data.

WHY WE CONSIDER VPN AN EASY SECURE OPTION IS THAT BECAUSE IT DO NOT STORE OUR DATA RATHER WHEN WE GET CONNECT TO THE VPN IT STORE OUR LOG REQUESTS IN TERMS OF LOGS BUT AFTER DISCONNECTING IT ALL THE LOGS GET DELETECD BUT RECENTLY INDIAN GOV. PASS THE BILL TO THE VPN PROVIDER TO STORE THE ALL 5YRS OF LOGS BUT THE COMPANIES DENYING IT.




                        DARK WEB 
IT WAS FIRSTLY MADE FOR THE USA MILITARY JUST LIKE HOW FIRSTLY INTERNET AND TELEPHONE MADE FOR THE MILITARY.

THEY MADE THE [TOR BROWSER /ONION WEBSITE] JUST TO BEING ANONYMOUS FROM THE OTHER.


CLIENT    REQUEST TO VISIT YT SERVER OF ONION DOMAIN [ONION DOMAIN ARE FREE BECAUSE THEY ARE TEMPORARY]

SO TOR BROWSER WILL DO WHAT IT WANNA DO

=>TOR BROWSER HAVE 3 TOR NODE[SERVER] 

1st ENTRY NODE
2nd MIDDLE NODE
3rd EXIT NODE 

whenever i connect to the tor and request to visit any website so then my request go to the tor 
then [MY IP ADDRESS WILL CONNECT TO TOR BUT WITHOUT GIVING THE DESTINATION IP ADDRESS SO THAT ISP DON'T KNOW WHERE DID I GO TO 


SO THE DATA WHICH I REQUESTED THE TOR BROWSER ENCRYPT IT INTO THE 3 LEVELs

MY REQUEST [YOUTUBE.COM] then it get encrypted by 1st level then 2nd and then 3rd like:

ENCRYPTION LVL:    1st      2nd       3rd

   YOUTUBE.COM => XYZ.S => MNO.AR => QRST.NP

ENCRYPTED 3TIMES THEN IT GO TO [ENTRY NODE] THEN IT WILL DECRYPT IT ONLY TILL THE 1 LEVEL Eg: [QRST.NP => MNO.AR] AND AND GIVE SEND IT TO [MIDDLE NODE] THROUGH ITS [ENRTY NODE] IP ADDRESS SO IT WON'T SHOW MY IP ADDRESS

THEN [MIDDLE NODE] DECRYPT THE LEVEL 2nd Eg:[ MNO.AR => XYZ.S ] AND SEND IT TO EXIT NODE BY ITS [MIDDLE NODE] IP ADDRESS 

THEN EXIT NODE DECRYT THE 1st ENCRYPTION Eg:[ XYZ.S => YOUTUBE.COM ] SO EXIT NODE DECRYPT IT AND REQUEST TO THE YOUTUBE SERVER THEN YOUTUBE SERVER WILL GIVE DATA TO THE EXIT NODE THEN EXIT NODE WILL ENCRYPT IT 3TIMES/3LEVELS [YOUTUBE.COM => QRST.NP =>  MNO.AR => XYZ.S]  AND DECRYT IT BY ONE LEVEL [QRST.NP => MNO.AR ] THEM SEND IT TO THE MIDDLE NODE BY IT'S OWN IP ADDRESS THEN MIDDLE NODE DECRYPT THE DATA OF EXIT NODE BY THE 1LEVEL [MNO.AR => XYZ.S] AND SEND IT TO THE FIRST NODE BY ITS OWN IP ADDRESS AND THEN ENTRY NODE WILL WILL DECRYPT THE MIDDLE NODE ENCRYPTION BY 1LEVEL [XYZ.S TO CILENT IP ADDRESS] 

SO OUR ISP WILL NOT GET TO KNOW WHAT WEBSITE WE HAVE SEARCHED OR GONE TO ,BUT OUR ISP KNOWS THAT WE HAVE USE THE TOR BROWSER.

THIS IS WHY TOR BROWSER IS TOO LOW.

AND ALL LOGS OF FILE WILL GET DELETED AFTER DISCONNECTING IT WILL DELETE THE HISTORY.


TO SEE GLOBAL INTERNET CONNECTION -[SUBMARINE CABLE MAP].


AND IF WE USE THE TOR WITH VPN THEN ISP WON'T ALSO KNOW THAT WE ARE USING TOR BROWSER.


ON SOME WEBSITE THERE ARE 6 NODE SECURITY ALSO.


IP ADDRESS DON'T GET DISTRIBUTE RANDOMLY.

INTERNET DON'T WORK RANDOMLY.

LET'S SAY IF WE WANT IT TO VISIT A SERVER SO IT'S ROUTERS DUTY FROM WHICH ROUTE IT WILL GONNA SEND OR DATA IN THE PACKETS.
