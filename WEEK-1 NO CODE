                                                            COMPUTER NETWORK.

ARPANET 4 universites of america made up

before that internet also exist but it as too much flaw: 
          1) CIRCUIT SWITCHING: USES TELEPHONIC NETWORK WIRES( where people use to plug & unplug the connection of b/w RECEIVER & SENDER so there was no privacy because other people can hear and see those messages) so telephone can only read/understand digital signal so WE NEED TO CONVERT THIS signal into DIGITAL SIGNAL (BINARY LANGUAGE BASE OF 2 [O & 1])
             SO THEY USED MODEM[MODILATOR & DEMODILATOR] USE TO CONVERT ANALOG SIGNAL TO BINARY CODE DIGITAL SIGNAL & VICE VERSA.

THEN SOME MESSAGE SWITCHES COMES INTO PLACE 
          2) MESSAGE SWITCHING: IT TAKES ALL THE MESSAGES IN A SINGLE WAPPER/PACKET FROM THE SENDER AND GIVES TO THE RECEIVER AT ONCE AND ALL THROUGH THE NODES/ROUTER [SO DO TO SIZE OF MESSAGE BANDWITH WERE LOW THAT TIME, SO MUCH HUGE LATENCY OF DELIVERING MESSAGES IS RAISED UP.

 APARNET COMES IN FIX ALL PROBLEM

APARNET: ESTABLISED IN 1960 AND THERE FIRST MESSAGE WHICH THEY SUCCESSFULLY DELIVERED WAS [LOGIN] IN 1969.THOUGH ONLY STARTING TWO LETTER SUCCEED TO DELIVER (L,O) THEN THEIR SYSTEM CRASHED BUT THEY GET THE IDEA THAT THIS THING WORKED UP FOR THEM.
         THE MECHANISM THEY USED IS [PACKET SWITCHING]

PACKET SWITCHING: SLICING, PEIRCING, CUTTING THE LARGE SIZED DATA INTO SMALL PIECE OF CHUNKS OF PACKETS. eg: 100Mb of data they split it into the small size of packets part each having one tenth size of 100Mb.

AND any packet go through any telephone lines path they will delivered to the same place.[ THAT IS HOW TORRENT WORKS AND BITTORENTS AND EVERY O.THER ALL SOCIAL MEDIA, TWITCH,YT AND BANKING SECTOR WORKS ]

EVERY PACKET CONTAINS: DELIVERY ADDRESS, SOURCE ADDRESS, MINIMUM SIZE CONTAIN.




                                                                          IP ADDRESS [INTERNET PROTOCAL ADDRESS]
1974: AMERICA ESTABSLISED- TCP/IP these are rules to make the internet work through the rule: because every other country want it to make the internet as they want.

TCP/IP: ROUTER/NODE CAN`T READ AND UNDERSTAND EVERY DIFFERENT CHARACTERS SO THE USA MADE UP ASCII values, UTF-8,UTF-16,UTF-32.

PACKETS MUST HAVE SOURCE ADDRESS,DESTINATION ADDRESS,MINIMUM SIZE OF EACH PACKETS, ROUTE OF PACKET.

Eg: TWO COUNTRY HAVE DIFFERENT LANGUAGES BUT TO INTERACT WITH EACH OTHER THEY MUST COMES WITH SINGLE LANGUAGE THAT IS HOW TCP/IP PROTOCOL MADE UP.


                                                                    IP ADDRESS- UNIQUE ADDRESS 
TO DELIVER EVERY THING & ANYTHING IN THE WORLD WE NEED RECEIVER ADDRESS AND VERIFY IT RECEIVER NEEDS SOURCE/SENDER ADDRESS 
THIS WHOLE IP ADDRESS[NETWORKING SYSTEM] IS MADE UP THROUGH USING POST OFFICE SYSTEM THATS HOW INTERNET MADE UP.

EVERY OTHER IP ADDRESS HAS UNIQUE ADDRESS.

IP ADDRESS: 32BITS also known as IPV4 [4 BYTES= 32Bits]  1BYTE = 8BITS  => MB>Mb [ Byte(B) , bit(b) ]   bits are made up by LOGIC GATES [electron trap in a GATE]

      IP ADDRESS: FORMAT=> 192.36.15.8   HOW IS THIS MADE UP AND THIS FORMAT WE FOLLOWS ONLY.

                          0-255.0-255.0-255.0-255  THIS IS HOW IP NUMBER HAVE FORMAT AND LIMIT

WE CAN SEE OUR IP ADDRESS THROUGH OUR TERMINAL IP ADDRESS CONTAINS OUR DETAILED LOCATION THAT WHERE WE ARE LIVES. IP ADDRESS HAVE OUR INTERNET PROVIDER DNS ADDRESS


IPV4[ 4 BYTES ]=> 32 BITS   [1 BYTE. 1BYTE. 1BYTE. 1BYTE] => THIS MADE UP FOR HUMANS SO THEY CAN READ IT.

                            [8 BIT. 8 BIT . 8 BIT. 8 BIT] => 2 TO THE POWER OF 8 [2^8]=[256 TOTAL {0 OR 1}

WHENEVER WE CONNECT TO INTERNET FOR FIRST TIME I GET THE IP ADDRESS FROM THE INTERNET PROVIDER. [ SOURCE SENDER & RECEIVER BOTH THE IP ADDRESS DEPENDING UPON THEIR LOCATION]

ALL THE DEVICES WHICH CONNECT THE INTERNET ARE ROUTERS,NODES AND THEY HAVE THEIR ONE INDEPENDENT IP ADDRESS.

IF 32 BITS OF IP ADDRESS WE HAVE SO HOW MANY DEVICES WE CAN GIVE THE ADDRESS OF THESE IP 

2 TO THE POWER OF 32 [2^32 = 4,294,967,296] , BUT THERE ARE MORE THAN BILLIONS OF DEVICE SO HOW THEY CAN COVER UP ALL THE DEVICE WHO CONNECT TO INTERNET THERE ARE ONLY 429 CRORES OF IP ADDRESS.

NOW IN 20`s CENTURY WE USE IPV6 [ ITS WRITTEN IN HEXADECIMAL 16 TO THE POWER OF 32]

TO SEARCH THE WEBSITE IN THE SEARCH ENGINE NOW WE DONT PUT UP THEIR IP ADDRESS TO OPEN UP THEIR WEBPAGE INSTEAD WE SEARCH THIER WEBSITE NAME WITH THEIR DOMAIN NAME HOW IS THIS WORK.
           =>IT POSSIBLE BY THE HELP OF DNS: 

                                                         DOMAIN NAME SYSTEM [DNS] [COMPUTERS ONLY UNDERSTAND THE IP ADDRESS] NOT THE DOMAIN NAME BUT WE AS A HUMAN CANNONT MEMORISE ALL THE WEBSITES DOMAIN NAME.
                                                         WE ARE MORE FIMALIER TO LETTER`S LIKE ADDRESS Eg: YOUTUBE.COM BUT COMPUTERS BROWSER DONT UNDERSTAND THIS.
CILENT GIVES REQUEST AND SERVER FULLFILL THEIR REQUESTS.

LETS SEE HOW THIS WORKS: DNS CONVERT INTO IP ADDRESS IN THE BROWSER [ BROWSER USE TO RENDER THE PROGRAMMING LANGUAGES TO SHOW THE INTERFACE ].

                                 WE SEARCH THE YT IN BROWSER OUR REQUEST GO TO [ISP- INTERNET SERVICE PROVIDER]

       IPS HAVE CACHE MEANS PRE-CONTAIN DATA [CACHE MEANS MEMORY A FAST READ AND WRITE MEMORY USED IN CPUs, RAM & GPUs etc] SO THE WEBSITE OPEN TOO FASTLY [MEANS KISI BHI WEBSITE KO BAHOT JADA VISITS KARTE H TOH WOH BAHOT JALDI KHUL JATI H MAGAR HUM KISI WEBSITE PHELI BAAR OPEN KARTE TOH WOH TIME LETI H KHULNE ME THAT IS WHAT CACHE MEMORY DO]

IF MORE PEOPLE COMING TO SOME SERVER SO THEY STORE THE CACHE DATA OF THAT WEBSITE IN THEIR SERVER. BUT IF ISO DONT HAVE THE THAT CACHE SO IT SEARCH THAT IP FROM THE OTHER SERVER LIKE ROOT NAME SERVER.


RNS[ROOT NAME SERVER] GIVES THE PORTAL OF ANY SPECFIC DOMAIN SERVER NAME WEBSITE LIKE [ .com .net .gov .in etc]

SO THE RNS SAYS TO ISP KI ME TUJHE ASEY SERVER KE PASS BHEJ DETA HU KI JISME SAME DOMAIN KA SERVER ME SAME [.com or .in or .net] ke sare listed website ka list ho

toh RNS ISP KO USH SERVER KE PASS POCHAYA JINME .com WALE WEBSITE KI LIST[INFORMATION] HO PURI.    RNS only read type of domain requested website have and give the ISP that server where that domain list[information] have.

then ISP COMES TO TLD [TOP LEVEL DOMAIN- server] & TLD DONT GIVE THE IP ADDRESS TO ISP but IT GIVES THE ANOTHER SERVER NAME WHICH HAVE THE REQUESTED WEBSITE IP ADDRESS.[ THIS SERVER CALLED AS ANS[ AUTHORITIVE NAME SERVER ].

CLIENT REQUEST IN BROWSER-> ISP-> RNS-> TLD ->ISP-> ANS-> ISP-> CLIENT BROWSER.

FASTEST-> RESISTOR > CACHE > RAM > GPUs > CPUs > SSD > HHD


THERE ARE TWO TYPES OF IP ADDRESSES:                              THERE ARE 13 TOTAL TLD SERVER IN THE WORLDWIDE.

1) STATIC IP ADDRESS: WEBSITES WHOSE IP ADDRESSES NEVER CHANGED THEY ARE REGISTERED ONLINE [eg: YOUTUBE etc]
2) DYNAMIC IP ADDRESS: WEBSITES WHOSE IP ADDRESSES GETS CHANGED [ NORMAL USER LIKE US OUR IP ADDRESS GETS TAKEN FROM THE INTERNET SO THAT ISP CAN GIVE TO OTHER PEOPLES ALSO TO THEIR USERS THEY RE-ALLOCATE THE IP ADDRESSES AMONG THE USERS ].

THERE ARE TOO MANY [ANS] SERVERS AND ALL HAVE SAME INFORMATION AT A TIME IF ANY SERVER IS FREE THEN NOW ITS DUTY OF ANS TO GIVE THE IP OF REQUESTED WEBSITE TO THE ISP. 

                                        DNS PROVIDER => HOSTINGER,GO DADDY.

EVERY DOMAIN HAS DIFFERENT TYPES TLD

  WHO GIVE WRITES TO GODADDY TO SELL DOMAIN

IP ADDRESS WE CLASSIFY THE IP ADDRESS INTO THE 5 PARTS:

CLASS A: I GAVE 50% OF IP ADDRESS TO THIS. EXAMPLE=> [0-127] BITS OF ADDRESSES [0-127. 0-127. 0-127. 0-127]
CLASS B: 25%  [128-191._____._____._____]
CLASS C:12.5% [192-223._____._____._____]
CLASS D:6.25% [224-239._____._____._____]
CLASS E:6.25% [240-255._____._____._____]


{0-255._____._____._____} => 256-BITS [32 BYTES]

WHY CLASSES ARE MADE UP?

EVERY NETWORK PROVIDER IP ADDRESS IS DIFFERENTS OUR ROUTER & SIM IP ARE DIFFERENT.
