                                                            COMPUTER NETWORK.

ARPANET 4 universites of america made up

before that internet also exist but it as too much flaw: 
          1) CIRCUIT SWITCHING: USES TELEPHONIC NETWORK WIRES( where people use to plug & unplug the connection of b/w RECEIVER & SENDER so there was no privacy because other people can hear and see those messages) so telephone can only read/understand digital signal so WE NEED TO CONVERT THIS signal into DIGITAL SIGNAL (BINARY LANGUAGE BASE OF 2 [O & 1])
             SO THEY USED MODEM[MODILATOR & DEMODILATOR] USE TO CONVERT ANALOG SIGNAL TO BINARY CODE DIGITAL SIGNAL & VICE VERSA.

THEN SOME MESSAGE SWITCHES COMES INTO PLACE 
          2) MESSAGE SWITCHING: IT TAKES ALL THE MESSAGES IN A SINGLE WAPPER/PACKET FROM THE SENDER AND GIVES TO THE RECEIVER AT ONCE AND ALL THROUGH THE NODES/ROUTER [SO DO TO SIZE OF MESSAGE BANDWITH WERE LOW THAT TIME, SO MUCH HUGE LATENCY OF DELIVERING MESSAGES IS RAISED UP.

 APARNET COMES IN FIX ALL PROBLEM

APARNET: ESTABLISED IN 1960 AND THERE FIRST MESSAGE WHICH THEY SUCCESSFULLY DELIVERED WAS [LOGIN] IN 1969.THOUGH ONLY STARTING TWO LETTER SUCCEED TO DELIVER (L,O) THEN THEIR SYSTEM CRASHED BUT THEY GET THE IDEA THAT THIS THING WORKED UP FOR THEM.
         THE MECHANISM THEY USED IS [PACKET SWITCHING]

PACKET SWITCHING: SLICING, PEIRCING, CUTTING THE LARGE SIZED DATA INTO SMALL PIECE OF CHUNKS OF PACKETS. eg: 100Mb of data they split it into the small size of packets part each having one tenth size of 100Mb.

AND any packet go through any telephone lines path they will delivered to the same place.[ THAT IS HOW TORRENT WORKS AND BITTORENTS AND EVERY O.THER ALL SOCIAL MEDIA, TWITCH,YT AND BANKING SECTOR WORKS ]

EVERY PACKET CONTAINS: DELIVERY ADDRESS, SOURCE ADDRESS, MINIMUM SIZE CONTAIN.




                                                                          IP ADDRESS [INTERNET PROTOCAL ADDRESS]
1974: AMERICA ESTABSLISED- TCP/IP these are rules to make the internet work through the rule: because every other country want it to make the internet as they want.

TCP/IP: ROUTER/NODE CAN`T READ AND UNDERSTAND EVERY DIFFERENT CHARACTERS SO THE USA MADE UP ASCII values, UTF-8,UTF-16,UTF-32.

PACKETS MUST HAVE SOURCE ADDRESS,DESTINATION ADDRESS,MINIMUM SIZE OF EACH PACKETS, ROUTE OF PACKET.

Eg: TWO COUNTRY HAVE DIFFERENT LANGUAGES BUT TO INTERACT WITH EACH OTHER THEY MUST COMES WITH SINGLE LANGUAGE THAT IS HOW TCP/IP PROTOCOL MADE UP.


                                                                    IP ADDRESS- UNIQUE ADDRESS 
TO DELIVER EVERY THING & ANYTHING IN THE WORLD WE NEED RECEIVER ADDRESS AND VERIFY IT RECEIVER NEEDS SOURCE/SENDER ADDRESS 
THIS WHOLE IP ADDRESS[NETWORKING SYSTEM] IS MADE UP THROUGH USING POST OFFICE SYSTEM THATS HOW INTERNET MADE UP.

EVERY OTHER IP ADDRESS HAS UNIQUE ADDRESS.

IP ADDRESS: 32BITS also known as IPV4 [4 BYTES= 32Bits]  1BYTE = 8BITS  => MB>Mb [ Byte(B) , bit(b) ]   bits are made up by LOGIC GATES [electron trap in a GATE]

      IP ADDRESS: FORMAT=> 192.36.15.8   HOW IS THIS MADE UP AND THIS FORMAT WE FOLLOWS ONLY.

                          0-255.0-255.0-255.0-255  THIS IS HOW IP NUMBER HAVE FORMAT AND LIMIT

WE CAN SEE OUR IP ADDRESS THROUGH OUR TERMINAL IP ADDRESS CONTAINS OUR DETAILED LOCATION THAT WHERE WE ARE LIVES. IP ADDRESS HAVE OUR INTERNET PROVIDER DNS ADDRESS


IPV4[ 4 BYTES ]=> 32 BITS   [1 BYTE. 1BYTE. 1BYTE. 1BYTE]

                            [8 BIT. 8 BIT . 8 BIT. 8 BIT] => 2 TO THE POWER OF 8 [2^8]=[256 TOTAL {0 OR 1}

WHENEVER WE CONNECT TO INTERNET FOR FIRST TIME I GET THE IP ADDRESS FROM THE INTERNET PROVIDER. [ SOURCE SENDER & RECEIVER BOTH THE IP ADDRESS DEPENDING UPON THEIR LOCATION]

ALL THE DEVICES WHICH CONNECT THE INTERNET ARE ROUTERS,NODES AND THEY HAVE THEIR ONE INDEPENDENT IP ADDRESS.

IF 32 BITS OF IP ADDRESS WE HAVE SO HOW MANY DEVICES WE CAN GIVE THE ADDRESS OF THESE IP 

2 TO THE POWER OF 32 [2^32 = 4,294,967,296]
